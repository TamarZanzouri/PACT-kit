The purpose of the risk mapping exercises is to give each participant space to reflect on where and when they feel most vulnerable, and to identify the ‘panic’ situations where they may require the app. This is a personal exercise and only a few participants need share back their reflections with the wider group.

Geographical mapping (45 min individually + time for group feedback) – Each participant is provided with a large sheet of white paper and coloured markers.

People can create their map in multiple ways, there is no recommended format. They may decide to use symbols to mark places, they may create multiple versions to show difference between day/night or they can indicate time of day with colours. What is important is that they have the chance to reflect on the places/ moments they feel at risk.

1. Start by mapping out your geographic space.
2. Then mark the routes, spaces, moments where you feel most vulnerable.
3. Which three trusted contacts would you want to contact in a situation of risk? Would it be the same three contacts for each situation on your map?
