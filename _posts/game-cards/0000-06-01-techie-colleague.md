You are a colleague of the human rights defender who is also concerned about, and trained in digital security matters.

###Information
Data may be leaked because the human rights defender was carrying their mobile phone and was logged into their email and social media accounts. As soon as you receive the Panic Button alert, your task is to ensure that your NGO’s IT systems are secure and uncompromised. To do so, warn the IT Director of your NGO about the risk to accounts and files belonging to the NGO.

Make sure that you have obtained all the necessary data from your human rights defender at risk before the alert is set off! As proof, you will receive a **security key** to let you know the systems are safe.

React fast when you receive the alert. Start by locating the IT Director of your NGO. You will be able to identify this person because they will be wearing a name tag stating **“IT director"**.

Provide information to the IT Director. When they are satisfied, they will provide you the data key to let you know systems are safe. Once you have the key you can reconvene with the other responders in your team and bring the evidence of each task to the Game Masters.
