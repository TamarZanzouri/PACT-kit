The PDF documents in this folder are meant to be printed out and used in the workshops to assist trainers. There are two types of cards: the **workshop activity cards** and the **game cards**.

##Workshop Activity Cards

The 7 activity cards all have two pages, and are meant to be printed front-rear on the same sheet of paper. **Fold the printed sheets down the bold black line on page 1**: that will put the description inside the card, and help you use the card as quick reference during the activities.

##Game Cards

###Rule Book

The name of the file is **1-1-1—imPACT Game Rules**. You are free to print this document as you prefer. For the sake of saving paper and the environment, we suggest you print it front-rear on a single sheet of paper.

###Player Cards
Print these document each on its paper sheet, then **fold it in half vertically** so that the empty side is inside, and you create a long and tall strip of paper. You can also use some paper glue to make it stronger. Next, fold the strip horizontally: it is meant to be put visibly on a player's body (in a shirt pocket, for example) so that player information and the icon are showing. You will notice **Key Figures** have two icons — one will be hidden in the pocket. The hidden icon can be ripped off and given to the player as proof of collecting that player's token.
