As the Head of the National Human rights Defenders Coalition you have the authority to ensure that the Coalition takes action on certain cases, as long as they are within organisational priorities and there is strategic relevance to working on the case.

###Main Requisites
- Accurate biographical data about the HRD
- Clear picture of the circumstances of disappearance (when did it happen, what do we know about how it happened, how did they find out about it)
- Information on why they believe the HRD is being held at the named detention facility
- **Informed consent**: is there any risk in naming the HRD in the Urgent Action? Is the HRD aware of these risks and have they given their informed consent to be named in the UA?  

###Hard mode
- request a photo
- pretend you need a written consent form to release the UA  
- Ask for proof of detention: claim that without solid proof the Coalition could be attacked for libel, or face repercussions from the authorities.
