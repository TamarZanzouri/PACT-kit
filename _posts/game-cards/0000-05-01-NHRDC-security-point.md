You are the security focal point of the National Human Rights Defenders Coalition, a strong national network of NGOs and civil society members whose priority is to ensure early warnings to its members in relations to security threats to civil society.

###Information
As soon as you receive the emergency alert from the human rights defender, your task is to ensure that the other members of the Coalition are aware of the aggression and take the necessary precautions to be vigilant. You need to convince the Coalition’s Communications Officer to send a **security information email** with important security advice to the coalition’s contact lists.

In order for this email to be effective, you have to give the Communications Officer all of the most important and relevant information. Make sure you have collected all important personal information about the HRD and the circumstances of their disappearance before the alarm is set off.

React fast when you receive the alert. Start by locating the communications coordinator. You will find them because they will be wearing a name tag stating **“Coalition’s Communications Officer”**.

Once you have obtained the security information email, you can reconvene with the other responders in your team and bring the evidence of each task to the Game Masters.
