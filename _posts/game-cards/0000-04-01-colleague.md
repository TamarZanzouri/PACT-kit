You are a colleague of the human rights defender. You're not a security expert, but you understand campaigning and are able to mobilise your organisation. As soon as you receive the emergency alert your task is to lobby key influencers to help get the defender released.

###Information

You will need to contact the EU Mission delegation and pressure them to get involved in the case. If you are successful, you will be provided with the **business card** of the EU delegation’s HRD focal point. Ensure you note down important personal information about the human rights defender and what you know about the circumstances of their disappearance. You will likely need verification of the incident, so consider this when creating the PACT with the rest of your team.

React fast when you receive the alert. Start by locating the European Union Mission delegation staff person. You will find them because they will be wearing a name tag stating **"EU Mission Delegate”**.

You may need to meet with the other responders in your team to see if their tasks can be used to show verification of the incident. Once you have obtained the business card you can reconvene with the other responders in your team and bring all the evidence of each task to the Game Masters.
