---
You work for one of the biggest human rights INGOs in the world, which has a regional office in the country. You try to maintain good connections with members of civil society; HRD protection is an organisational priority for you.

###Main Requisites
- A good explanation of what happened, the circumstances of detention (including about how they found out about it, i.e. the Panic Button)
- Information about the response plan that has been set up. Who is involved? How would the public statement fit into other responses that are being planned?  
- Proof that the HRD has given informed consent to be named in a public statement
- What would be the impact of a public statement on the situation for the HRD? Is there a risk in naming them in a public statement? Does this risk outweigh the benefits?

###Hard mode
- How has the information been verified?
- Is there a photo? Is there consent to use that photo?
- Background information on the HRD's work to make sure it fits the strategic direction of your INGO.
- You are worried that more than a public statement will be needed, but that you don't have the capacity for further work.
