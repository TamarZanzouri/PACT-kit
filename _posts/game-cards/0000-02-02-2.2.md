Start by locating the Head of the National Human Rights Defender Coalition. You will find them because they will be wearing a name tag stating “The Head of the National Human Rights Defender Coalition”.

 In order to do this the head of the coalition will need as much information as possible about the defender and the circumstances of their disappearance. The Head of the National Human Rights Defender Coalition will require certain pieces of information in order to write the urgent action so make sure you are prepared to answer some of the following questions by getting as much information as possible from your human rights defender. Watch out as there may be additional surprise questions so ensure you plan ahead!

Once the Head of the National Human Rights Defender Coalition has released the Urgent Action they will give you a copy. Once you have this you can reconvene with the other responders in your team and bring evidence of each task to the Game Masters.
