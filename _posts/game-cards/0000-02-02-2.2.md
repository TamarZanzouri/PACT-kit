- can give them an additional hard time about consent pretending you need a written consent form to release the UA (which of course you donâ€™t but the point is to make the think about how much proof of consent they really need).  
- Can also push them on why they think the HRD is at that detention facility, claiming that without solid proof the Coalition could be attacked for libel or could face security or administrative repercussions from the authorities. "
context: "Help players understand why this figure is important, and what their actions mean in the big picture"

- Have accurate biographical data about the HRD
- Have a clear picture of the circumstances of the disappearance/detention (i.e. when did it happen, what do we know about how it happened) (including about how they found out about it, i.e. the Panic Button)
- Information on why they believe the HRD is being held at the named detention facility
- Is there any risk in naming the HRD in the urgent Action? Is the HRD aware of these risks and have given their informed consent to be named in the UA?
