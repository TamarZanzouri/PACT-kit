You are the Security Focal Point of the NGO your HRD works for. Your NGO is member of the National Human Rights Defenders Coalition. You are the main contact point when anyone in the organisation is facing a security situation, and you need to ensure a coordinated emergency response.

###Information
Start by locating the Head of the National Human Rights Defender Coalition. You will find them because they will be wearing a name tag stating **“The Head of the National Human Rights Defender Coalition”**.

The Head of the National Human Rights Defenders Coalition will need as much information as possible about the defender and the circumstances of their disappearance. They will require certain information in order to write the urgent action, so make sure you are prepared to answer their questions by getting as much information as possible from your human rights defender. Be careful: there may be additional surprise questions, so plan ahead!

Once the Head of the National Human Rights Defender Coalition has released the Urgent Action they will give you a copy. Once you have this you can reconvene with the other responders in your team and bring evidence of each task to the Game Masters.
